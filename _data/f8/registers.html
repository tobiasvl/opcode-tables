ISAR:

The Indirect Scratchpad Address Register (ISAR) consists of two 3-bit octal registers (ISARU and ISARL). It is used to access the 64 scratchpad registers (although the first 12 scratchpad registers can be accessed directly as well).




Scratchpad registers:

There are 64 8-bit scratchpad registers.

The first 12 (0–11) can be accessed directly through the corresponding number.

Scratchpad 9 uses the alternate name J when used with `LR J, W` or `LR W, J`.

Scratchpads 10 and 11 together form the 16-bit register H when used with `LR DC, H` and `LR H, DC`. They can also alternately use the names HU and HL when used with `LR A, HU`, `LR HU, A`, `LR A, HL` and `LR HL, A`, but 10 and 11 are also valid in that case.

Scratchpads 12 and 13 together form the 16-bit register K when used with `LR K, P` and `LR P, K`. They also use the names KU and KL when used with `LR A, KU`, `LR KU, A`, `LR A, KL` and `LR KL, A`. The names 12 and 13 are not valid here, but instead load through ISAR.

Scratchpads 14 and 15 together form the 16-bit register Q when used with `LR P0, Q`, `LR DC, Q` and `LR Q, DC`. They also use the names QU and QL when used with `LR A, QU`, `LR QU, A`, `LR A, QL` and `LR QL, A`. The names 14 and 15 are not valid here; 14 instead loads through ISAR, and 15 is invalid.

All the scratchpad registers can be addressed through ISAR, but scratchpads 12–64 must use ISAR.
